(use finalAlexHRCode) 
The code's function is to parse the heartrates from "AlexHR1sec" into an hourly basis and calculate the calories based off the average
heartrate (New CSV files will be created for each hour and the amount of calories burned). The only thing needed to run this code is age, weight, and gender. 
NOTE: This only works with the file called "AlexHR1sec".
